# Tornado Predictions - Machine Learning

## Project Goal

For this project our group decided to analyze the tornado occurrences in the U. S since 1950, and build a machine learning model to predict tornado category (EF scale).

Overall, the number of tornado occurrences has been increasing and presumably will keep increasing, due to the changing weather patterns in the United States and elsewhere.

### Research Question

How has the number of tornadoes changed over the past seven decades in the United States?

## Data sources

  * Source: https://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/ 
  * File: 1950-2019_all_tornadoes.csv

## App

Data cleaned and transformed by using Python Jupyter Notebook.

Python Flask API used.

## Data Analysis and Visualization

Objectives

* How has the occurrences changed geologically? Which states/cities have been more experiencing the tornadoes?

* How do the length and the width correlate to the magnitude of the tornado?

* What months show the higher number of occurrences?
